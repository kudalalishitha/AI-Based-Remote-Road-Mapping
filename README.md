# AI-Based-Remote-Road-Mapping
AI-Based Remote Road Mapping uses satellite imagery and machine learning to automatically detect, classify, and map road networks. This system enhances accessibility in remote or hard-to-reach areas and supports efficient infrastructure planning and monitoring.

# Description:
Deep Globe Detection is a web-based application for detecting and analyzing features in satellite imagery using deep learning. It provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images, running detection models, and viewing results. The project is built using the Django framework and is suitable for research, education, or deployment in real-world geospatial applications.
The system is modular, featuring separate apps for admin control, user interaction, image handling, and backend processing.

# Features:
Upload satellite images through a browser interface
Automatically detect objects or land features using a deep learning model
User authentication system (login, logout, session handling)
Admin dashboard for managing users and uploaded data
Organized storage for uploaded media and static files
Uses a lightweight SQLite database for quick setup and testing

# Dataset Information:

The project is designed to work with satellite imagery datasets. By default, images are stored in the dataset_images/ folder. You can use any dataset of satellite images, such as:
DeepGlobe Land Cover Classification Dataset
SpaceNet dataset
Custom annotated satellite images (in RGB format)
If the dataset includes labels or masks, the system can be extended to support training and evaluation.

# Technologies Used:
Backend:
Python 3.x
Django web framework
SQLite3 (for development)

Machine Learning / Deep Learning:
TensorFlow or PyTorch (choose one depending on your model)
NumPy
OpenCV (for image preprocessing)

Frontend:
HTML, CSS
Bootstrap (via Django templates)
JavaScript (optional for interactivity)
